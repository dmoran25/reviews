    - Each **new review** brings in **~100 more views per month**.
    - **2% of those views** (2 out of every 100 people) will take action (call, visit, book, or buy).
    - If your average customer lifetime value is **${clv}**, then every **new review** can bring measurable revenue growth.
    
    **Why 2% Conversion Rate?**  
    - Based on local business benchmarks, a **2% conversion rate** from new views generated by reviews is a **solid estimate**.
    - Businesses with **optimized Google Business Profiles** and **active reviews** often reach **5-10% conversion rates**.
    - **High-intent searches ("best near me")** make users more likely to convert.
