    **Why a 5% Conversion Rate?**  
    - Based on local business benchmarks, a **5% conversion rate** from new views generated by reviews is a solid estimate.
    - Businesses with optimized Google Business Profiles and active reviews often reach **5-10% conversion rates**.
    - **High-intent searches ("best near me")** make users more likely to convert.
    
    **How We Calculate Revenue Increase:**  
    - Each **new review** brings in **~100 more views per month**.
    - **5% of those views** (5 out of every 100 people) will take action (call, visit, book, or buy).
    - If your average customer lifetime value is **${clv}**, then every **new review** can bring measurable revenue growth.
    
    **Example:**  
    - If you need **{reviews_needed} more 5-star reviews** to reach **{target_rating}**, and each review brings in potential new customers, your estimated **monthly revenue increase** is **${revenue_increase:,.2f}**.
